I've done my first self-made mobile app. 
I made this app in around one month and published it here, but I won't be publishing it on the app store because it has no original features, has been made just for learning and mobile project experience. 
I am currently working on a fitness app that is much more aesthetic, functional and professional. will be published on the app store.
